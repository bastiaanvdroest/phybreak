\arguments{
\item{obsize}{The outbreak size (number of cases) to obtain. If \code{obsize = NA}, \code{popsize} should be provided.}

\item{popsize}{The population size in which to simulate. If it is not defined (default), 
an optimal population size will be chosen based on R0 and obsize. Be aware that choosing a \code{popsize} and
an \code{obsize} can severely increase the simulation time, depending on \code{R0}.}

\item{samplesperhost}{Number of samples to be taken per host, either a vector or a single number.}

\item{introductions}{The number of index cases when simulating a multiple introduced outbreak.}

\item{intro.rate}{The rate in which introductions appear. The \code{intro.rate} is the parameter of the exponential waiting time distribution between the 
introductions.}

\item{R0}{The basic reproduction ratio used for simulation. The offspring distribution is Poisson.}

\item{spatial}{If \code{TRUE}, the hosts are placed on a square with density 1, and a distance kernel is used to 
model transmission probabilities between the hosts.}

\item{gen.shape}{The shape parameter of the gamma-distributed generation interval.}

\item{gen.mean}{The mean generation interval.}

\item{sample.shape}{The shape parameter of the gamma-distributed sampling interval.}

\item{sample.mean}{The mean sampling interval (for the first sample of each host).}

\item{additionalsampledelay}{Sampling intervals since first sampling times of each host. Values in this vector will be 
used first for all additional samples of host 1, then of host 2, etc.}

\item{wh.model}{The model for within-host pathogen dynamics (effective pathogen population size = 
N*gE = actual population size * pathogen generation time), used to simulate coalescence events. Names and numbers are allowed.
Options are:
\enumerate{
  \item "single": effective size = 0, so coalescence occurs 'just before' transmission in the infector (complete bottleneck)
  \item "infinite": effective size = Inf, with complete bottleneck, so coalescence occurs 'just after' transmission in the infectee
  \item "linear": effective size at time t after infection = \code{wh.level + wh.slope * t} (complete or wide bottleneck; if complete, \code{wh.level = 0})
  \item "exponential": effective size at time t after infection = \code{wh.level * exp(wh.exponent * t)} (wide bottleneck)
  \item "constant": effective size = wh.level (wide bottleneck)
}}

\item{wh.bottleneck}{Whether the bottleneck should be complete or wide, which is only an option if \code{wh.model = "linear"} 
(in that case, \code{"auto"} defaults to \code{"complete"}).}

\item{wh.slope}{Within-host slope, used if \code{wh.model = "linear"}.}

\item{wh.exponent}{Within-host exponent, used if \code{wh.model = "exponential"}}

\item{wh.level}{Within-host effective pathogen size at transmission, used if \code{wh.bottleneck = "wide"}
(if \code{wh.model = "exponential"} or \code{"constant"}, and optional if \code{wh.model = "linear"})}

\item{wh.history}{Within-host coalescent rate of the history host. Rate = 1/\code{wh.history}.}

\item{dist.model}{The distance kernel to use if \code{spatial = TRUE}. Options are:
\enumerate{
  \item "power": a power law function pr(dist) ~ 1 / (1 + (dist/dist.scale) ^ dist.exponent)
  \item "exponential": an exponential function pr(dist) ~ exp(-dist.exponent * dist)
}}

\item{dist.exponent}{Distance model exponent.}

\item{dist.scale}{Distance model scale, only with power law distance model.}

\item{mu}{Expected number of mutations per nucleotide per unit of time along each lineage.}

\item{sequence.length}{Number of available nucleotides for mutations.}

\item{...}{If arguments from previous versions of this function are used, they may be interpreted correctly through 
this argument, but it is better to provide the correct argument names.}
}
\value{
The simulation output as an object of class \code{'phybreakdata'} with sequences (class \code{'phyDat'}) and 
  sampling times (which would be the observations), and infection times, infectors, and phylogenetic tree 
  of class \code{\link[ape]{phylo}}.
}
\description{
Simulate outbreaks of class \code{phybreakdata}, with the outbreak model of \pkg{phybreak} (\code{sim.phybreak} is deprecated).
