\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{phybreak}.}

\item{plot.which}{Either \code{"sample"} to plot the current state or a selected posterior sample, 
\code{"mpc"} or \code{"mtcc"} to plot a consensus transmission tree (see \code{\link{transtree}}) or \code{"mcc"}
to plot the maximum clade credibility tree (see \code{\link{phylotree}}).}

\item{samplenr}{If \code{plot.which = "sample"}, this indicates which posterior tree should be plotted: 
\code{samplenr = 0} to plot the current state.}

\item{select.how}{Method to select subset of hosts to plot, in combination with \code{select.who}. 
Options are \code{"trees"}, in which case subtrees are plotted with index cases defined in \code{select.who}.  
Options are:
\enumerate{
  \item "trees": subtrees starting with cases defined in \code{select.who}, with all progeny. This is the default, starting with \code{"index"},
    so that all cases are selected.
  \item "pruned": prunes the complete transmission tree to the minimum fully connected subtree containing all cases in 
    \code{select.who}, plus all cases needed to link them. Include \code{"index"} for the index case.
  \item "leaves": plot only the hosts in \code{select.who}. Here, including \code{"index"} has no effect.
}}

\item{select.who}{Vector of hosts used to select subset of hosts to plot, in combination with \code{select.how} (explained above).
Can be given as named hosts, where \code{"index"} can be used to plot the index host with selection methods \code{"trees"} and \code{"pruned"},
or as numbers, where \code{0} indicates the index host.}

\item{mar}{Plot margins.}

\item{tree.lwd}{Line width of phylogenetic trees.}

\item{tree.col}{Colours of the host phylogenetic trees. Defaults to evenly spaced hues in \code{hcl}, 
with \code{c = 100} and \code{l = 65}.}

\item{hostlabel}{Whether to print the host names.}

\item{hostlabel.cex}{Size of host names. Defaults to a value between 0.5 and 1
depending on outbreak size.}

\item{hostlabel.pos}{Position of host names, either just right from the host's phylogenetic tree,
or aligned at the right hand side of the plot (\code{"right"}).}

\item{hostlabel.col}{Colours of the host names. Defaults to same as tree colours.}

\item{samplelabel}{Whether to print the sample names.}

\item{samplelabel.cex}{Size of sample names. Defaults to a value between 0.4 and 0.8
depending on outbreak size.}

\item{samplelabel.pos}{Position of sample names, either just right from the host's phylogenetic tree,
or aligned at the right hand side of the plot (\code{"right"}).}

\item{samplelabel.col}{Colours of the sample names. Defaults to same as tree colours, matching the host.}

\item{mutationlabel}{Whether to print the number of mutations on each edge in the phylogenetic trees, 
calculated with parsimony reconstruction using \code{\link[phangorn]{ancestral.pars}}. 
Only for edges with > 0 mutations.}

\item{mutationlabel.cex}{Size of mutation labels. Defaults to same as sample label.}

\item{mutationlabel.pos}{Position of mutation label on edge. Default is \code{"right"}, which is on the
node to the right, otherwise it is centered.}

\item{label.space}{Scales the space at the right-hand side to place the host and sample names.}

\item{host.col}{Colour of shading behind the host phylogenetic trees. Defaults to same as tree colours.}

\item{host.alpha}{Transparancy of shading behind the host phylogenetic trees.}

\item{cline.lty}{Line type of vertical lines showing the transmission contacts.}

\item{cline.lwd}{Line width of vertical lines showing the transmission contacts.}

\item{cline.col}{Colour of vertical lines showing the transmission contacts. If \code{NULL}, the tree colours are used.}

\item{cpoint.pch}{Character \code{par("pch")} used for points indicating the transmission contacts, 
both at the tips and roots of the phylogenetic trees.}

\item{cpoint.cex}{Size of transmission contact points.}

\item{cpoint.col}{Colour of points indicating the transmission contacts, associated with the secondary case,
both at the tips and roots of the phylogenetic trees. Defaults to same as tree colours.}

\item{xlab}{X-axis title.}

\item{axis.cex}{Size of tick labels.}

\item{title.cex}{Size of X-axis title.}

\item{...}{Further graphical parameters (see details).}

\description{
Plots a \code{phybreak}-object as a transmission tree with coloured phylogenetic trees for each host. The default 
  is to plot the current state, but any posterior sample can be chosen, as well as various consensus trees.
}
\section{Details}{
 
  Graphical parameters can be added by using names in the format \code{prefix.parameter} for the
  different parts of the plot. The \code{parameter} will then be passed on to the appropriate 
  graphics function, e.g. \code{tree.lty} to change the line type of the phylogenetic tree. The following 
  prefixes can be used: \code{tree} for the phylogenetic trees, \code{hostlabel} for the host names,
  \code{samplelabel} for the sample names, \code{host} for the host's shading areas, \code{cline} for 
  the vertical contact lines, \code{cpoint} for the transmission contact points, \code{axis} for 
  the X-axis, and \code{title} for the X-axis title.
